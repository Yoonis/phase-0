- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great putting the material into action right away and watching the actions materialize right on my local browser.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I liked learning about semantic HTML5 elements and about the improvements from HTML4. I'm a big fan of organization, so it was fun learning how to structure the foundation of a document before we start playing around with style sheets.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Pretty well. If it weren't for the screenshot example at the top of this challenge, I think many people (myself included) would have attempted to pull off weird HTML formatting, like nesting the unordered list within table columns, to try to achieve what's seen on the site. The validation link provided also helped ensure my code was sound.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's good for the framework of a site and for the visually impaired, but it doesn't do much in terms of design nor media elements. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I didn't employ any tricks, just rote memorization... This resource also comes in handy!
