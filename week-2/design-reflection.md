<b>What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?</b>  

The 6 phases are as follows:  

1.  Information Gathering: Know the purpose of the site, set goals, study the target audience, and lastly, know the content type involved (product/service/ecommerce/information).
2.  Planning: Develop the site map and optionally, choose the CMS.
3.  Design: Work closely with the client on site prototypes.
4.  Development: Create the home page, followed by shells for the interior pages. Functionalize all interactive forms and ecommerce booking engines. 
5.  Testing and Delivery: Finalize the site, test across browsers, bug fix, and deliver via FTP. Once the site is on the client's server, do one more QA. Now is the time to install CMS and SEO plugins as well.
6.  Maintenance: Site updates and backups.

<b>What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
What kind of content will your site feature?</b>  

The purpose of my site is for users to get to know about me, find ways to contact me, and see what I've created and learned thus far. It will feature a personal blog, my work history, a portfolio of my projects, and a live stream of my music feed.

<b>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</b>  

Since they are clicking on my link, I would assume these users are interested in my portfolio, my capabilities, and a bit about me as a person outside the realm of work. My site would address these interests by delivering the content mentioned in the answer above.

<b>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</b>  

The primary actions are for the user to see my bio on the home page containing ways to contact me, and to skim through my portfolio and work history. If they should be so inclined, they can also learn more about me by viewing my blog and my music streaming page.

<b>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</b>  

Design is an aesthetically pleasing, visually packaged solution to a client's needs. Much of the value in design comes from the structuring of content into multiple prototypes with multiple rounds of client input to achieve a certain goal, whether it be a higher click through rate, more orders, etc.  

User experience (UX) is fathered from a psychological background that focuses on how a user feels as they navigate through a site. Usability is a major component in UX, but not the only one. Others include accessibility, marketing, human factors, utility, and ergonomics.

<b>What is user experience design and why is it valuable?</b>  

User experience design is designing with the end user in mind in order to optimize their experience. In theory, the better the user experience is, the more likely it will yield favorable results for the client. However, user experience is difficult to measure because it is inherently subjective. Since it cannot be accurately quantified, this makes it hard for companies to justify setting aside a budget to hire an experienced UX designer, especially when there will be an overlap of skills between the UX designer and the traditional design team.

<b>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</b>  

I used Slickplan to design my site map, and signing up and trying out the interface was not so much tedious as it was unnecessary. It's good to know apps like this exist, but as Release 2 notes suggested, that was far more sophisticated a tool than I needed to accomplish the task at hand.  

On another note, now that these reflections are getting longer, I also took extra time to learn a bit more about Markdown syntax. 

After my first push to master, my image was not working. I followed the ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg) instruction externally linked in Release 3, but the <b>/path/to/</b> portion threw me off. I thought the path was intended to be our own local directory path, but after troubleshooting, it seems the path should be the remote GitHub path to the image that I had also pushed up to master.
