        <h2>What are the benefits of version control?</h2>
        <p>Version control is critical because projects call for multiple members to a team. It's not possible to always be collaborating side by side, so aach member will be working with their own local copies. Keeping tabs on all copies allows each team member to work with autonomy, and the team will still be able to maintain a master copy of everyone's collective, merged work at the end of the day.

        Another important advantage comes in if new code introduces bugs. Version control allows the team to rollback to their latest, functioning version while they work to fix the bug.</p>

        <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
        <p>git allows the user to push incremental commits to the remote repo. All commits are saved to a history, which can be viewed on GitHub or by typing git log on the CLI.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a central hub that all team members can access to collaborate on projects. Fully merged, master versions of code can be pulled, updated, and stored at any time.</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I find myself returning to <main> <section> <nav> <header> and <footer> because they very clearly break out my page content. Other tags like <article> and <aside> are important to know, but I haven't been able to make much use of them so far since my content has been pretty simple.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are laid out on the page in a top down, sequential manner which follows the structure we set in our HTML. This same order applies to the browser display. The only interesting thing is that in DevTools, I can see the commented out section of my file being placed above the closing body tag and closing html tag. Of course the comments don't appear on the page itself, but in the HTML file, I had placed the comments below these closing tags.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned about this handy Sublime snippet feature. I will most likely be using this knowledge to create starting boilerplates for other languages, or templates to reoccurring loops and methods. One of the default Sublime snippets contains Lorem Ipsum text, which I know I will be making use of soon.
