What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It's important to know the type of content to be linked, the relationsip of the link content to your main file, and lastly the correct path to the link file.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
To achieve a mirror of positioning on the actual site, we used CSS properties like float, margin, display, text-align, width, and height, to name a few. It took a lot of trial and error, and at one point it was pretty difficult because we got stuck on a positioning issue that took us a long time to track back to our floating styles.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
To modify styles, we used properties such as font-weight, font-size, and color.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes, classes were added to almost all of our HTML tags. For example, every time we had to format a single letter or line differently than the rest of the content in one section or header, we added span tags and then classes to the span tags to achieve these singular changes.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
The major difference is that the actual site had the links formatted in a table, while our links were formatted as an unordered list. In my opinion, our list was easier to read and write, with the caveat that we had to split it into 2 unordered lists in order to float each list into a column. Without prior CSS experience, we ran into a float formatting issue that really had us scratching our heads for some time. Because of this, I'll concede that the actual site's table format is probably best practice because it's taking care of the column requirement right in the HTML.
