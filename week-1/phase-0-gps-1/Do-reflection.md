<b>What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?</b>
I wasn't sure how to switch the upstream remote branch that pushes would be designated to.

<b>What concepts were clarified during the GPS?</b>
During the GPS my guide clarified that there is an option to set the upstream remote branch, but that it's not suggested because it would then become the default for every push. I learned that the best way to ensure your pushes are made to the desired remote branch is by using the command git push origin "branch name".
I also learned what to delete in a file in order to resolve a conflict and successfully merge commits. 

<b>What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?</b>
I asked if it was best practice to delete a branch immediately after every merge. Since I've been completing the full git cycle by myself each time so far, I also asked when my responsibility ended in the cycle, and my guide clarified that in most scenarios I would go as far as opening a pull request. Then my code would ideally be reviewed by another team member, who would then complete the merge.

<b>What still confuses you about git?</b>
At this point I believe I have the basic git workflow and cycle down. Probably my biggest concern is remembering to check which branch I'm on before I do anything, and also keeping track of all the existing branches.

<b>How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?</b>
I felt very supported. I thoroughly enjoyed speaking with my guide Gary and getting to grill him with all my pressing questions. Just as with the reflection papers after each challenge, I think having these GPS's the week after a topic is taught really helps reinforce what was learned. This first GPS was a bit unconventional since I didn't have a pair involved to practice switching between driving and navigating, so I'm looking forward to trying that out the next time around.
