_Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository._

_Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person._
Navigate to your GitHub page. Click on New, fill in the missing fields, and select MIT for licensing.
Once you are on the repo page, copy the URL on the bottom right, go to your terminal, and type in git clone "URL".

_Describe what open source means._
Open source means code is free for distribution, and accessible to anyone who would like to fork the repo and make changes.

_What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?_
With private enterprises, the source code is not available to the public, and therefore the community cannot benefit from what's already been achieved in the private software and would potentially be re-inventing the wheel. I think Open Source is great for the development community at large, as long as what's released does not contain sensitive information.

_Assess the importance of using licenses._
Licenses define the level of access people have to your code. 

_What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?_
The add, commit, and push concepts were solidified in this challenge. 
At first I struggled with the workflow of pushing to a remote branch, pulling into the remote master, and then pulling from the remote master to the local master. My 'aha' moment came after going through this cycle a couple times.

_Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it._
This goes back to the previous section, but I needed further clarification on what HEAD^ was, and found some information on this link:
