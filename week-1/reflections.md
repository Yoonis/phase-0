#1.1 Think About Time

Some time management tips I learned include the Pomodoro technique, tackling work from a micro level, not starting the day by outlining a routine, the importance of meditation and breaks, and lastly, that difficulty levels can be adjusted to nudge myself into a state of flow.

Time Boxing is essentially blocking off a set period of time to focus entirely on a task. The head and tail ends of each of these periods should be used for reflection. After each time set, there is a short break to refresh the mind. This idea can be applied directly to Phase 0 tasks, although instead of the Pomodoro technique of 25 minutes, I personally prefer to increase the time block a little higher.

Currently I apply the micro-level work approach, where I just get started on a task without thinking about how long I need to keep at it, or what I need to accomplish before I stop. I find that I fall into the work and accomplish a fair amount when I am not under time constraints or the pressure of meeting self-inflicted goals. My current strategy definitely helps fight my tendency to procrastinate, which I believe is essentially paralysis stemming from thinking of the big picture goals that will ultimately need to be done. 

On top of the micro-level approach I already employ, I will make an effort to consistently apply the Time Boxing technique with a timer by my laptop. I know this will benefit my studies by adding a bit more structure and discipline. Eventually I'd like for this to develop into habit, where I can rely on self-awareness rather than a timer to know when is a healthy point to break.


##1.2 The Command Line

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell allows a user to communicate with the computer's OS, either via CLI or GUI. Bash is the default shell for Linux and OS X.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging aspect for me overall was the volume of commands, but with rote practice I can see the efficiency gains of incorporating commands into everyday use. 
The hardest single cmd was Pipes and Redirection, because you could potentially chain them into one complex cmd.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
-Pwd to know where you are, especially if you get too crazy with the popd and pushd cmds.
-mkdir, rmdir, cd, find with wildcards, and ls all make it so easy to navigate around. I find that I'm already abusing cd.
-touch, cp, mv, less, grep, and cat make file manipulation easy.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd: tells user their current directory location

-ls: displays all files within a directory

-mv: moves files and also renames files

-cd: changes directory, can be supplemented with additionals like - or .. for more mobility

-../: Not 100% sure, but I believe it can be combined with cd as mentioned above to skip 2 directories in a path

-touch: creates a new file

-mkdir: creates a new directory

-less: displays the contents of a file in a separate view, which you have to press q to exit from

-rmdir: removes a directory, but only when it's empty

-rm: removes a file

-help: displays a menu with available cmds
