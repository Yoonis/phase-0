# --- REFLECTION -------------------------------------------------------
# Write your reflection below as a comment.

=begin

1. Which error was the most difficult to read?
The load error, because I had never come across it before and had to research if opening a file from ruby was even possible.

2. How did you figure out what the issue with the error was?
All of the error messages were very clear on the type of errors, the location of errors, and the content Ruby was expecting to see.

3. Were you able to determine why each error message happened based on the code? 
Yes.

4. When you encounter errors in your future code, what process will you follow to help you debug?
The first thing I will do is jump to the line number where the error stems from, and troubleshoot from there by taking advantage of all the information provided in the error message.
